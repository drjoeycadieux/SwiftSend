# **App Name**: SwiftSend

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Allow users to securely connect and authenticate using email/password.
- Initiate Transfer: Enable users to specify recipient email, and amount to send.
- Process Payment: Interface with a mock payment gateway using an API (using the 'fetch' command in NextJS) to 'process' the money transfer, generating success/failure notifications.
- Emoji Recommendation: Use an AI tool to help choose an appropriate emoji reflecting the amount of the transfer. Higher values get celebratory emojis. Lower values might trigger emojis suggesting sympathy, etc. Present this to the sender as a recommended addition to their transfer.
- Transfer Confirmation: Display a confirmation screen with transfer details (recipient, amount, date) using dummy/mocked data, after 'successful' payment.
- Transaction History: Display transaction history for each user, with mocked transactions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and security, like established financial institutions.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a desaturated hue of the primary, providing a neutral backdrop to ensure readability and focus on the content.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0), an analogous hue, for interactive elements, calls to action, and important notifications, giving the app a modern edge.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern user experience.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons to represent different functionalities (e.g., sending, receiving, history).
- Use a clean, intuitive layout with clear information hierarchy. Employ a mobile-first responsive design.
- Subtle animations on button presses and loading screens to provide feedback and enhance the user experience.
